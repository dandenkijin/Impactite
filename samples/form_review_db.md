<!--
This is a form (type: form) that saves data to the DATABASE.

destination: database -> saving appends a record to the form_records table
                         inside .tag_index.db (the same DB as the tag index).
catalog: reviews      -> the catalog label of the record; you can filter
                         queries by it:  FROM database/reviews

Fill in the form in view mode and press "Save" — then open queries_database.md
to see the record in the query results.
